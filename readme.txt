Create and display heat maps from custom SQL queries. Define row, column, and value fields, select color ranges, and render via shortcode.

== Description ==
Heat Map Graph lets administrators build data heat maps backed by SQL SELECT queries on WordPress tables. Configure:

- Query: a single SELECT statement targeting WP tables
- Field mapping: row, column, and value fields produced by the query
- Color range: hex colors for min and max
- Status: enable/disable

Use the shortcode on pages/posts:

`[heat_map_graph id="123"]`

Security features:
- Validates SQL is a single SELECT against WP tables only
- Blocks DML/DDL keywords
- No multiple statements
- Admin-only UI with nonces and strict sanitization

On activation, two sample heat maps are created:
- Posts per Day per Category (Last 30 Days)
- Number of Post Tags per Category

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin folder `heat-map-graph` to `/wp-content/plugins/`

3. Under Heat Map Graph in the admin menu, create a heat map or use samples
